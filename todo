Testing

# in tests, test the passed in line feed, and test the encoding https://perldoc.perl.org/Encode/Guess.html
# test that default has expected attributes?
# need to test functional/object methods the same.
# Need to test using JSON::PP and Cpanel::JSON::XS the same

# should we have files that I know are generated with those settings and then compare?
# reference https://metacpan.org/source/NEILB/File-JSON-Slurper-0.03/t ?
# We could have files that are generated with those settings? Like slurper settings, or encoder/decoder settings, or file slurper settings
# the test class can have the JSON encoder that it used to generate that file.
# reusable test helpers for functional/object interfaces so we're not duplicating code.
